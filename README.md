A collection of bash scripts to assit with managing markdown files as described in the above blog post. 

#### init.sh 
Initialization script - Configure your desired directory tree and index filename at the top of the script. It will then crawl the tree and build the index files (default filename: index.md). Note: Use an underscore "\_" character instead of a space when naming your directories. The underscore "\_" will be converted to a space when displaying links.
